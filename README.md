#### Git and GitHub Secrets (GitHub Universe 2015)

###### Abstract 
What do these secrets look like to someone who works at GitHub? There are a few ways to answer. In teaching others how to use Git and GitHub, we have found certain useful, well-documented features remain under-appreciated and under-used. In building GitHub, we have developed a few techniques for using the platform with maximum efficiency. This session aims to cover both "types" of secrets, with a bias for the practical over the esoteric.
