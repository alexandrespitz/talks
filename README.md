#### Git and GitHub Secrets (GitHub Universe 2015)

###### Abstract 
What do these secrets look like to someone who works at GitHub? There are a few ways to answer. In teaching others how to use Git and GitHub, we have found certain useful, well-documented features remain under-appreciated and under-used. In building GitHub, we have developed a few techniques for using the platform with maximum efficiency. This session aims to cover both "types" of secrets, with a bias for the practical over the esoteric.

#### GitHub + CI/CD (Velocity Santa Clara 2015)

###### Abstract 
GitHub integrates with a wide spectrum of third party tools, giving you considerable flexibility when setting up a deployment pipeline. So where do you begin?

In this tutorial, we will give a demonstration how one uses these integrations in practice. You will learn how to implement CI and CD incrementally, so you can start building, or iterate on, you organization's pipeline. We will also cover more advanced techniques, to give you a broader sense of what is possible. Throughout, we will touch on the foundation for all these integrations: the GitHub API. You will gain an appreciation for how existing third party tools use the API, and learn how to use it to implement new tools of your own. In addition, we will provide an overview of GitHub's own software deivery processes, and how we have evolved them over the years.

With that tooling in place, we will then review how best to use it. That will include identifying common mistakes, and how to avoid them. We will also outline the challenges that arise when creating depolyment pipelines for large, complex projects.
